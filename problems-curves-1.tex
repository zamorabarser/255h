\begin{exercise}
    Find the curve of intersection of the cylinder  $(x - 3) ^2 + (z + 1 )^2 = 9$ and the plane $2x + 3y - 2z = 5$
\begin{hint}
First find $x(t)$ and $z(t)$ so that no matter how you define $y(t)$, the curve you get lives in the cylinder and wraps around once.
\end{hint}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
    Find parametrizations of the curves that form the sides of the triangle $\Sigma$, where $\Sigma $ is the intersection of the plane $- x  - 2y + z = 7 $ with the first octant. 
\begin{hint}
For points $p$ and $q$, the line segment from $p$ to $q$ can be parametrized as $\gamma (t) = p + t (q - p)$ with $0 \leq t \leq 1$.
\end{hint}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
    Find parametrizations of the curves that form the edges of the surface  $\Sigma$, where $\Sigma $ is the portion of the sphere  $  (x- 3) ^2 + (y - 2 ) ^2 + (z- 5 ) ^2 = 36  $ with $x \geq 3$ and $z \geq 5$. 
\begin{hint}
$\Sigma $ is like the peel of an orange slice. The edges are two half-circles going from $(3, -4, 5)$ to $(3,8,5)$
