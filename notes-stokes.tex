\section{Stokes Theorem}

Let $F (x,y, z) $ be a space vector field, and $p $ a point in the domain of $F$. Let $C\subset \mathbb{R}^2 $ be a very small circle around $p$, positively oriented (counterclockwise).  Then the integral
\[       \int_C F \cdot ds    \]
measures how much counterclockwise rotation around $p$ is generated by $F$. It turns out we have another quantity that measures precisely that: 
\[       \text{curl}(F)(p)  .    \]
